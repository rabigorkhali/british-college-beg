          <h3><strong>Course Description</strong> </h3>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The TQUK level 3 Diploma in Business Administration is designed to equip
              students with a broad understanding of business organisations, whilst providing them with specific subject
              knowledge which will qualify them as specialists in the fields of marketing, customer care, human
              resources, finance, team leadership, communication, and business policy and strategy.
              <br />
              In order to develop the learner’s management strategies, and provide them with the key administrative
              skills needed for business success, modules throughout the diploma will improve the student’s
              understanding of how to manage complex administrative processes. As such, this qualification is suitable
              for learners wishing to enter into it, or progress within, a career in business administration. It is also
              ideal for entrepreneurs and the heads of small organisations, as it will help them to understand the
              basics of doing business.
              <br />
              All units are internally assessed by a personal tutor, through a range of assessments that include a
              portfolio of evidence - and at the end of the course, TQUK will carry out an External Quality Assurance of
              the qualifications. Learners will receive further support throughout the course from fellow students
              through our social forums, as well as excellent faculty and exemplary facilities.
              .
